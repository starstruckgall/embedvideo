Has you school blocked access to youtube?
No worries. Using this simple embedding trick this python program should allow you  to veiw youtube videos. 
Altarnivly you could create your own html file by pasting a youtube videos code you  get by double clicking on an embedded youtube video from any site and clicking 'copy embed code' 
and then just change the src attribute from ...watch?=v... to embed/...
Happy after school day, dude!
